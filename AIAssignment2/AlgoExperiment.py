### Data Structures
#
# The state of the board is stored in a list. The list stores values for the
# board in the following positions:

# -------------
# | 0 | 3 | 6 |
# -------------
# | 1 | 4 | 7 |
# -------------
# | 2 | 5 | 8 |
# -------------
#
# The goal is defined as:
#
# -------------
# | 1 | 2 | 3 |
# -------------
# | 8 | 0 | 4 |
# -------------
# | 7 | 6 | 5 |
# -------------
#
# Where 0 denotes the blank tile or space.
